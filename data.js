I came up with this thing while at Yahoo! Search and we used it there in production. So, it must be working. While probably not practical for many sites, the takeaway might very well be: optimizations are all around us, we just have to look around for them.</p>\n<p>The summary: browsers have built-in search boxes which also give you search suggestions. IE8+ have added <em>visual</em> search suggestions, meaning images. The trick here is - when you don't have a visual suggestion, why not \"suggest\" an image for preloading, such as a sprite. Or two.</p>\n<p>On to the details.</p>\n<h3>Chrome search</h3>\n<p>Every browser these days has them search boxes. Usually in the upper right. Like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/1-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"1-search\" width=\"333\" height=\"242\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1548\" /></p>\n<p>(Aside rant: I call these browser search boxes \"chrome search\", but with the advent of the Chrome browser by Google and the fact that Google does search, this is now confusing, even doubly so. So next time you name a project or a company using a name that is already full of meaning such as Chrome or Closure, you're just being unimaginative and.. yeah, not cool. Unless of course it's something like Apple that's too far off from the actual product.)</p>\n<h3>Chrome search suggestions</h3>\n<p>Depending on how the search provider was set up, while you type the browser can send the partial string you typed to a URL of the search provider's choice. The search provider then can return a list of suggestions. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2-search.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"2-search\" width=\"335\" height=\"238\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1549\" /></p>\n<p>BTW, you don't have to be Google or Yahoo in order to be a search provider. This is \"open search\" and any site could (and frankly, should) be a search provider, <a href=\"http://www.phpied.com/opensearch-enabling-your-blog/\">here's an example how</a>.</p>\n<h3>Visual chrome search suggestions</h3>\n<p>Starting with IE8, the provider can not only offer textual suggestions, but also visual ones, meaning images. So if you look up a stock symbol, it can give you a chart. Or a weather forecast.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/3-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"3-search\" width=\"355\" height=\"440\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1550\" /></p>\n<p>The search provider sends back JSON or XML to the browser. The visual thing requires XML actually. Here's <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/09/18/hello-world-getting-started-with-ie8-visual-search.aspx\">more from the horse's mouth</a>. So in order to send an image back you use a syntax like so:</p>\n<div class=\"hl-main\">\n<pre><span class=\"hl-code\">...\n</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Item</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Text</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">Currently: Partly Cloudy, 67F</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Text</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Description</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">High: 71F Low: 63F</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Description</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Url</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/ USCA1024_f.html</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Url</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Image</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-var\">source</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">http://path/to/my/image.png</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n         </span><span class=\"hl-var\">alt</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">Partly Cloudy</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-var\">width</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">31</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-var\">height</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">31</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">/&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Item</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n...</span></pre>\n</div>\n<h3>Preload in visual chrome search suggestions</h3>\n<p>So what if you don't have an appropriate image for a search term? Or maybe a partial term, say like for example \"sch\"? Why not load a sprite or some other image, hidden, 0x0 instead. Something that you can be reasonably confident the user will need once they get to the search results page. Easy-peasy:</p>\n<div class=\"hl-main\">\n<pre><span class=\"hl-code\">...\n</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Item</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Text</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">schmuck</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Text</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Url</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">http://whatever.org</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Url</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Image</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-var\">source</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">http://path/to/my/sprite.png</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n         </span><span class=\"hl-var\">width</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">0</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-var\">height</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">0</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">/&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">Item</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n...</span></pre>\n</div>\n<p>This way you're in effect preloading something that will be needed later. I mean once the user starts typing, there's a pretty decent chance they'll end up on the results page. And they are likely to prefer a fast results page. It will be fast when pieces of it were pre-downloaded.</p>\n<p>And if you inspect what's going on in HTTPWatch, you can see that as you type, the browser sends a request to the search provider, which then returns an XML document. And an image, although no image is seen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/search-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"search-4\" width=\"700\" height=\"296\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1551\" /> </p>\n<h3>What didn't work</h3>\n<p>I tried preloading CSS and JS too, but it didn't work. These show broken image icons, even with 0x0 size. I also tried 1x1 but then there's a 1x[LINE-HEIGHT] grey square/line.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/5-search.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"5-search\" width=\"630\" height=\"369\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1552\" /></p>\n<h3>And that's that</h3>\n<p>So here - a way to preload images for free, by simply using a browser feature. </p>\n<p>You can also use this to preload 1x1 beacons for DNS resolution purposes. Say you serve search suggestions from suggest.example.org but the results are on www.example.org and the static stuff is on static1.example.org, static2.example.org, etc. There's an opportunity to pre-resolve all these domain names by requesting a tiny image from each.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, this was the second post from the <a href=\"http://www.phpied.com/velocity-countdown/\">Velocity countdown</a>. Only 5 more days to go! Hope you learned something, even if you don't intend to use it right away. Or maybe at least you've decided to offer your site as a search provider to all browsers. Free marketing, why not?</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow.</p>\n","commentRss":"http://www.phpied.com/preload-in-visual-search-suggestions/feed/","yahoo:repeatcount":{"field":"link","content":"1"}},{"title":"Show Slow The Big One-O!","link":"http://feeds.showslow.com/~r/ShowSlowBlog/~3/fZr4CvgYO4Q/","comments":["http://www.showslow.com/blog/the-big-one-o/#comments","0"],"pubDate":"Thu, 09 Jun 2011 04:21:41 +0000","creator":"Sergey Chernyshev","category":"ShowSlow","guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://www.showslow.com/blog/?p=1608"},"description":"After 2+ years of development, Show Slow finally reached a 1.0 milestone!

The idea was to comment out a chunk of JavaScript you don't need right away and serve it this way. Later, when you need it, you get the content of the commented code and eval() it. More <a href=\"http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/09/gmail-for-mobile-html5-series-reducing.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.sproutcore.com/post/272853740/cut-your-javascript-load-time-90-with-deferred\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>At the last Fronteers conference I had the pleasure of chatting with <a href=\"http://chikuyonok.ru/\">Sergey Chikuyonok</a>, who is so great and (among other things) is responsible for coming up with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/\">zen coding</a> and writing a bunch of <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/sergey-chikuyonok/\">deep articles</a> on image optimization for Smashing Magazine. So he told me he experimented with similar lazy HTML evaluation and it proved to be incredibly helpful for mobile devices. Not only the overall experience is faster but the initial rendering happens sooner and we all know <a href=\"http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2010/public/schedule/detail/13019\">how important</a> that is.</p>\n<p>Sergey is a busy person and chances of him writing about his experiment in English seemed pretty low at the time, so I decided to do an experiment on my own and see what happens. Meanwhile he <a href=\"http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2010/html-lazy-load/\">did write about it</a> so I forgot all about my findings, but here they are now.</p>\n<h3>Long document</h3>\n<p>I took one big HTML document - <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661\">The adventures of Sherlock Holmes</a>, which is half a megabyte or about 200K gzipped. Page A is the document as-is, plus some JS for measurements.</p>\n<p>Page B (lazy) is the same page but with about 95% of its content commented out. The remaining 5% is a whole chapter so there's plenty of time to deal with the rest while the user is reading. After onload and a 0-timeout I take the commented markup (conveniently placed in <code>&lt;div id=\"lazy-daze\"&gt;</code>) and strip the comments. Then take the \"unwrapped\" time after another 0-timeout to let the browser repaint the DOM and regain control.</p>\n<p>The overall skeleton of the lazy page is like so:</p>\n<div class=\"hl-main\">\n<pre><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">!</span><span class=\"hl-var\">doctype</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-var\">html</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n\n</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">html</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">body</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">h1</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">THE ADVENTURES OF</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">br</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">/&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  SHERLOCK HOLMES</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">h1</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  ...\n  ... to chat this little matter over with you.</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">p</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">div</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-var\">id</span><span class=\"hl-code\">=</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-string\">lazy-daze</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">&quot;</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-comment\">&lt;!--</span><span class=\"hl-comment\">\n    &lt;p&gt;II.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n    At three o’clock precisely ...\n    ... she has met with considerable success.&lt;/p&gt;\n  </span><span class=\"hl-comment\">--&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n  </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">div</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n\n</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&lt;</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">script</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"hl-code\">\n</span><span class=\"hl-builtin\">window</span><span class=\"hl-code\">.</span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">onload</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> = </span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">function</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">(</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">)</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">{</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n\n    </span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">setTimeout</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">(</span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">function</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">(</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">)</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">{</span><span class=\"hl-code\">\n\n        </span><span class=\"hl-reserved\">var</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> </span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">daze</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> = </span><span class=\"hl-builtin\">document</span><span class=\"hl-code\">.</span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">getElementById</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">(</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">'</span><span class=\"hl-string\">lazy-daze</span><span class=\"hl-quotes\">'</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">)</span><span class=\"hl-code\">,\n            </span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">inner</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> = </span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">daze</span><span class=\"hl-code\">.</span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">innerHTML</span><span class=\"hl-code\">;\n\n        </span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">daze</span><span class=\"hl-code\">.</span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">innerHTML</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> = </span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">inner</span><span class=\"hl-code\">.</span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">substring</span><span class=\"hl-brackets\">(</span><span class=\"hl-number\">4</span><span class=\"hl-code\">, </span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">inner</span><span class=\"hl-code\">.</span><span class=\"hl-identifier\">length</span><span class=\"hl-code\"> -

<a href=\"http://www.phpied.com/files/lazyhtml/sherlock-plain.html\">http://www.phpied.com/files/lazyhtml/sherlock-plain.html</a><br />\nAnd the lazy one - <a href=\"http://www.phpied.com/files/lazyhtml/sherlock-lazy.html\">http://www.phpied.com/files/lazyhtml/sherlock-lazy.html</a></p>\n<p>In order to run the experiment you just go to<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.phpied.com/files/lazyhtml/start.html\">http://www.phpied.com/files/lazyhtml/start.html</a><br />\nAnd click \"Go nuts\". This will load each of the two documents 20 times and take a few time measurements. \"Go nuts\" again and you'll get 20 more data points.</p>\n<p>The time measurements I take are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"plain\" - unload to onload of the base version</li>\n<li>\"lazy\" - unload to onload of the lazy version NOT including unwrapping it. This should be quicker than the plain version</li>\n<li>\"unwrapped\" - unload to onload plus time to unwrap and rerender - this is expected to be bigger than \"plain\" because the browser has to render twice and is therefore doing more work</li>\n<li>DOM loaded \"plain\" - unload to DOMContentLoaded instead of onload</li>\n<li>DOM loaded \"lazy\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then I take the same 5 measurements but instead of starting at unload of the previous page, it starts at the top of the documents, as soon as a timestamp can be taken with JavaScript. This will exclude DNS, establishing connection, time to first byte...</p>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Here are the results from back when I did the experiment originally last year, using iPhone 2 (with iOS 3.2 or thereabouts)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/iphone3.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"iphone3\" width=\"471\" height=\"363\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1543\" /></p>\n<p>I ran this experiment over Wifi and again over 3G.</p>\n<p>First striking thing - it takes the about the same time to load the plain old page over Wifi and over 3G. For the smaller, \"lazy\" document, there is a difference, but there's virtually none for the plain base page. The guess here is that the rendering and its cost in terms of memory and CPU is far greater than the actual download time. In other words <em>it takes longer to render than it does to download an HTML</em>. At least in this class of phones. This guess is confirmed when you look at the time from the top of the documents, when the request overhead is removed:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_7591.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_7591\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1544\" /></p>\n<p>With or without the request time - it's all pretty much the same.</p>\n<p>The next striking thing - and how about that lazy document!<strong> It renders 3-4 times faster</strong> than the whole plain document. Not bad.</p>\n<p>And one more surprise - lazy+unwrap time is less than the plain old document. Now that's interesting. It appears faster to split the task into two and do the whole double-rendering, which should've been slower because it's extra work. I guess that poor phone really chokes on the long document.</p>\n<p>The same I found is true in Firefox, but almost the difference is negligible.</p>\n<h3>iPhone 4</h3>\n<p>I repeated the experiment tonight on iPhone 4 and wifi. And boy, is there a difference. What used to take 13 seconds is now under 3s.</p>\n<p>The lazy + unwrap time is more than the plain time, which was to be expected.</p>\n<p>Rendering that initial lazy document is still <strong>2-3 times faster</strong> that waiting for the whole document.</p>\n<p>The numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2765</strong> plain (2014 DOM)</li>\n<li><strong>1268</strong> lazy</li>\n<li><strong>2995</strong> lazy+unwrap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ignoring the request overhead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2200</strong> plain (1421 DOM)</li>\n<li><strong>715</strong> lazy</li>\n<li><strong>2423</strong> lazy+unwrap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And one last run/observation - on the 3G and iPhone 4 there isn't much benefit of lazy-evaluation and empty cache. The request seems much more expensive. unload to onload 4.9s where document top to onload is 2.5. When the request overhead is out of the picture than lazy eval wins again - 1.7s compared to 2.5s</p>\n<h3>Parting words</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lazy HTML FTW?</li>\n<li>Who the heck loads an entire book in a page?! Well it may happen. It may not be a whole book, but just a lot of markup. The entire book gzipped was 219K. A hefty document, but have you seen some of those news sites?</li>\n<li>Possible use case - blog comments. Lots and lots of blog comments. Or posts.</li>\n<li>If you're going to lazy-load something and get it with an ajax request, why not save yourself the request and ship with another chunk of html</li>\n<li>This was a simple layout task. Just a bunch of text. I'm guessing there could be much more complicated pages and layouts to render. And rendering is what takes the time it seems.</li>\n<li>Drawbacks a plenty because of the hidden content - accessibility, SEO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thoughts? Anyone want to <a href=\"http://www.phpied.com/files/lazyhtml/start.html\">run the test</a> on Android or any other phone/device/tab/pad/whathaveyou? The guess is that the newer/powerful the device the smaller the difference. But it will be nice to know.</p>\n","commentRss":"http://www.phpied.com/lazy-html-evaluation/feed/","yahoo:repeatcount":{"field":"link","content":"1"}},{"title":"Velocity countdown","link":"http://www.phpied.com/velocity-countdown/","comments":["http://www.phpied.com/velocity-countdown/#comments","0"],"pubDate":"Wed, 08 Jun 2011 08:51:30 +0000","creator":"Stoyan","category":"performance","guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://www.phpied.com/?p=1545"},"description":"Let me try to set the mood for Velocity 2011 with an attempt to publish one performance-y post a day for the seven days between now and when the conference starts. #7 - Lazy HTML evaluation #6 - Preload in visual search suggestions","encoded":"<p>Let me try to set the mood for Velocity 2011 with an attempt to publish one performance-y post a day for the seven days between now and when the conference starts. </p>\n<p>#7 - <a href=\"http://phpied.com/lazy-html-evaluation\">Lazy HTML evaluation</a><br />\n#6 - <a href=\"http://www.phpied.com/preload-in-visual-search-suggestions/\">Preload in visual search suggestions</a></p>\n","commentRss":"http://www.phpied.com/velocity-countdown/feed/","yahoo:repeatcount":{"field":"link","content":"1"}},{"title":"dynaTrace @ Velocity 2011","link":"http://blog.dynatrace.com/2011/06/07/dynatrace-velocity-2011/","comments":["http://blog.dynatrace.com/2011/06/07/dynatrace-velocity-2011/#comments","0"],"pubDate":"Tue, 07 Jun 2011 08:52:00 +0000","creator":"Andreas Grabner","category":["JavaScript/AJAX","Public Events","Ajax"],"guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://blog.dynatrace.com/?p=3769"},"description":"Web Performance Enthusiasts can&#8217;t wait until next week when Velocity 2011 opens its doors.

He said that he&#8217;d read my post about how <a title=\"Web Performance Today: Are you focusing on first and repeat views? Then you may be ignoring 96% of your page traffic.\" href=\"http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2011/05/10/flow-performance-measurement-page-speed-test-tools/\">most non-landing-page views are actually flow views</a>,  and he wanted to know how this related to the total number of object requests on each page. In my quest to look at the statistics we throw around every day in light of real-world data, I started to investigate.</p>\n<p>First, I examined the provenance of three sets of widely cited statistics about the size of web pages:</p>\n<h3>Google (2010): Average page is 320K and contains 44 objects</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2084\" title=\"Google: Web metrics: Size and number of resources\" src=\"http://www.webperformancetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/page-size-Google.jpg\" alt=\"Average number of page objects (2010)\" width=\"475\" height=\"303\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Google collected <a title=\"Google Code Blog: Web metrics: Size and number of resources\" href=\"http://code.google.com/speed/articles/web-metrics.html\" target=\"_blank\">this data</a> from a sample of several billions of pages that were processed as part of Google&#8217;s crawl and indexing pipeline. In processing these pages, they not only take into account the main HTML of the page, but also discover and process all embedded resources such as images, scripts and stylesheets.</p>\n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tests from which these numbers are derived assume that users are arriving at the site with an empty cache.</li>\n<li>All resources are fetched using Googlebot, which means they are subject to robots.txt restrictions. For example, some websites (such as BBC) block CSS and Javascript.</li>\n<li>Some sites may present a different view of the resources to Googlebot than to regular users. For example, until recently, Google&#8217;s own servers used to serve CSS and JS uncompressed to Googlebot, while compressing them for regular user browsers.</li>\n<li>Pages are rendered and subresources are discovered through the eye of WebKit. If a page serves resources differently for Internet Explorer or Firefox, those won&#8217;t be visible here.</li>\n<li>Sampling of pages for processing is not uniformly random or unbiased. For example, pages with higher PageRank are more likely to be included in these metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Charzinski (2010): Average page is 507K and contains 65 objects</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083\" title=\"Growth of Average Web Page Size\" src=\"http://www.webperformancetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/page-growth-graph-Andre-King.jpg\" alt=\"Graph courtesy of Andrew King at Web Site Optimization\" width=\"475\" height=\"382\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> These numbers have been widely publicized via performance consultant Andrew King&#8217;s well-known graph (above) and <a title=\"Web Site Optimization: Average Web Page Size Quintuples Since 2003\" href=\"http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.

But these tests all have one thing in common:<strong> they are all looking at the number of requests on a page with an empty cache.</strong></p>\n<p>This is obviously not how we use sites in the real world. I wanted to look at the <em>actual</em> number of resources sent to pages being served to real users.</p>\n<h3>My methodology</h3>\n<h4>1. Selecting test subjects</h4>\n<p>To gain some insight into this, I turned to Strangeloop&#8217;s data warehouse, which captures some very interesting statistics on page resources.  I narrowed my search by using the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sites that were segmenting traffic. (Web content optimization can dramatically change the number of requests, and I was not interested in looking at post-acceleration data.)</li>\n<li>Sites that were using <a title=\"Yahoo! Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Website: Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header\" href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#expires\" target=\"_blank\">expires headers</a> on most resources.</li>\n<li>Sites that did not use a content delivery network (CDN). (I needed to see all of the resource requests. Although this biases the insights towards smaller customers, I did not want to go through the hassle of cross referencing my findings with client CDN analytics, which are notoriously fickle.)</li>\n<li>Sites with 10M page views per month or more. (Although the non-CDN criterion biased me towards smaller customers, I did not want to go to too small.)</li>\n<li>Sites with generally templated pages. (Given that I needed to run WebPagetest on the sites to see how many requests they served with an empty cache, I wanted to find sites where this would be easy.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using these criteria, I found three customers who made excellent candidates for my test. (Obviously, this can&#8217;t compare with the billions of site crawled by Google, but I was looking for consistent trends. If my findings had been all over the place, I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this post right now. <img src='http://www.webperformancetoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>\n<h4>2. Determining number of requests for real-world pages</h4>\n<p>I selected key landing pages and representative sub pages for each site. I then searched our data warehouse to see how many resources were sent to browsers for each page.</p>\n<h4>3. Determining number of requests for pages with an empty cache</h4>\n<p>I then went to WebPagetest and ran tests on the same pages to see how many requests they had with an empty cache. Then I cross referenced this with the numbers I gathered in step 2.</p>\n<p>From steps 2 and 3, I came up with the following tables:</p>\n<h5>Landing pages</h5>\n<table style=\"background-color: #d9effc;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0.5\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"475\" bordercolor=\"#000000\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #99c6c9;\">\n<td><strong><br />\n</strong></td>\n<td><strong><small>Client 1</small></strong></td>\n<td><small><strong>Client 2</strong></small></td>\n<td><small><strong>Client 3</strong></small></td>\n<td><small><strong>Average</strong></small></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small>Empty cache: # of requests sent</small></td>\n<td><small>112</small></td>\n<td><small>89</small></td>\n<td><small>153</small></td>\n<td><strong><small>118</small></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small>Real world: # of requests sent</small></td>\n<td><small>73</small></td>\n<td><small>61</small></td>\n<td><small>112</small></td>\n<td><strong><small>82</small></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small>Difference (%)</small></td>\n<td><small>35%</small></td>\n<td><small>31%</small></td>\n<td><small>27%</small></td>\n<td><strong><small>31%</small></strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h5>Secondary pages</h5>\n<table style=\"background-color: #d9effc;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0.5\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"475\" bordercolor=\"#000000\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #99c6c9;\">\n<td><strong><br />\n</strong></td>\n<td><strong><small>Client 1</small></strong></td>\n<td><small><strong>Client 2</strong></small></td>\n<td><small><strong>Client 3</strong></small></td>\n<td><small><strong>Average</strong></small></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small>Empty cache: # of requests sent</small></td>\n<td><small>134</small></td>\n<td><small>72</small></td>\n<td><small>123</small></td>\n<td><strong><small>110</small></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small>Real world: # of requests sent</small></td>\n<td><small>52</small></td>\n<td><small>34</small></td>\n<td><small>45</small></td>\n<td><strong><small>44</small></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><small>Difference (%)</small></td>\n<td><small>61%</small></td>\n<td><small>53%</small></td>\n<td><small>63%</small></td>\n<td><strong><small>59%</small></strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The real world numbers looked suspiciously like repeat view numbers, so I ran a series of repeat view tests to see what was up. The results didn&#8217;t correlate to the real numbers at all, but I wanted to dig a bit deeper before laying this issue to rest. I ran WebPagetest flows  based on a sample of real user flows, and I saw that <strong>users were getting very different resources depending on how they got to that page</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Takeaway: To improve KPIs, keep your eyes on the real world</h3>\n<p>Clearly, this is a pretty small sample size, and I don&#8217;t expect my findings to rock your world. Obviously we can’t draw any sweeping conclusions, but I found it interesting how the real-world data <em>consistently </em>differed from the synthetic test data. It serves as yet another reminder of something that&#8217;s easy to forget: <strong>We can&#8217;t look at synthetic tests as our primary benchmark.</strong></p>\n<p>I continue to be evangelical about the fact that we can’t focus on synthetic tests because they don’t represent what actual users are seeing. <strong>If you think your users are seeing 110 resources and they are actually seeing half that &#8212; or even less &#8212; on secondary pages, you might change how you optimize or how you choose to implement optimization.</strong> If we want to improve key performance indicators, we must always keep our eyes on the real world.</p>\n<h3>Related posts:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Web Performance Today: Are you focusing on first and repeat views?

You may already have it installed on your site.* But did you check first to see what kind of performance impact it could have?</p>\n<p>Come to think of it, if you&#8217;re reading this post, chances are you <em>did </em>check to see what kind of performance impact it could have on your site. <img src='http://www.webperformancetoday.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  But if you did this, you&#8217;re in a tiny minority.</p>\n<p>At the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon, I see a lot of widget bandwagon-hopping, with people loading up their site with every new button and third-party tool that comes along, with little regard for the end result. <strong>In 2011, widgets are to websites what animated gifs were in 1996.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not against third-party content, of course. It&#8217;s how the web works these days, and many of these tools do provide real value. I&#8217;m all for widgets, provided they actually give you something in return: more conversions, page views, sales, or whathaveyou. But too often, <strong>third-party tools get slickly packaged and sold as &#8220;just a single line of Javascript&#8221; to site owners who don&#8217;t realize that &#8220;just a single line of Javascript&#8221; can mean anything</strong>. (My colleague Sergey Cherneyshev has created the abbreviation <a title=\"Show Slow: SLO-JS and how to speed up widgets\" href=\"http://www.showslow.com/blog/slo-js-and-how-to-speed-up-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\">SLO-JS</a> to help bring people back to earth when they hear this magical sales pitch.)</p>\n<p>Google, of course, being Google, <a title=\"Google Code Blog: Adding the +1 button to your site\" href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/+1button/\" target=\"_blank\">has addressed the performance question</a>, if somewhat vaguely, in their technical FAQs:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No, there is no significant latency impact from the placement of the &lt;script&gt; tag. However, by placing the tag at the bottom of the document, just before the body close tag, you may improve the loading speed of the page.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In my ideal world, however, every new third-party button or app would come with an awesome set of detailed performance notes, like <a title=\"Lanyrd Badge Documentation: Performance Notes\" href=\"http://lanyrd.com/services/badges/docs/#performance\" target=\"_blank\">these ones</a> that Lanyrd published with their badge release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The initial person-v1.min.js script is 2215 bytes, and is served from our Amazon CloudFront CDN. It should load extremely quickly, and won&#8217;t block the loading of your page even if Lanyrd.com itself is unavailable.</p>\n<p>That script than makes a single second call to Lanyrd to retrieve all of the necessary data, no matter how many different badges you have on the page. This call is handled by our Varnish cache server, so again it should be very fast.</p>\n<p>Badge responses are cached for 10 minutes, so it may take up to 10 minutes for a new conference you are tracking or attending to show up on your page.</p>\n<p>If Lanyrd is unavailable your page load time will be unaffected — the badges will simply fail to appear.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>All third-party apps are not made equal</h3>\n<p>Sure, Google being Google, you can probably count on them to deliver a speedy tool**, but can you extend this same trust to every third-party content provider out there, no matter how mega-huge? (Correct answer: No.)</p>\n<p>As ecommerce consultant Matthew Ogborne wrote about recently, <a title=\"The Last Drop of Ink: Facebook Like Button = 84Kb or 1.340 Seconds?\" href=\"http://lastdropofink.co.uk/personal/random-stuff/facebook-like-button-84kb-or-1340-seconds/\" target=\"_blank\">all those kilobytes can pile up fast</a>. He found that installing Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;like&#8221; button resulted in an extra 84k, which translated to 1.34 precious seconds. And as Tim Morrow <a title=\"Never Take Your Eye Off the Ball: Four mistakes Shopzilla made so you don’t have to\" href=\"http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2010/08/10/never-take-your-eye-off-the-ball-four-mistakes-shopzilla-made-so-you-dont-have-to/\">pointed out</a> at Velocity last summer, poorly implemented third-party content caused Shopzilla to lose most, if not all, of its hard-won performance gains.</p>\n<h3>For die-hard widget junkies, a couple of tips:</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Defer widgets so they&#8217;re one of the last page objects to load.</strong><br />\nThis is a great optimization technique because the button is a piece of third-party code that can slow down a page, and it’s not crucial to how a page functions.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Perform a cost-benefit analysis for each widget.</strong><br />\nYou need to make sure that the conversion gains (or whatever gains you&#8217;re anticipating) promised by the widget are not going to be killed by the performance losses it forces on you. Here&#8217;s a <a title=\"Web Performance Today: The three biggest performance problems with third-party content (and how to fix them)\" href=\"http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2010/08/17/the-3-biggest-performance-problems-with-third-party-content/\">simple how-to</a> for conducting this analysis.
